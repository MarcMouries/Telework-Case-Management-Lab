### Planning

Along with the ServiceNow instance URL and credentials, the I.T department sent you an email to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow App Engine.

ðŸ’¡ **Prework to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow**

**Prework**

1. Make a list of the data you need to track. Ex: Category of work
2. Reach for help on the channel @transformNow
3. If you're using a spreadsheet today, make a copy and keep only the data required. See the Don'ts section
4. Use the record producer to create a form quickly and reuse any relevant questions set
5. If case workers need to create and see tasks related to the case, add the related list ( "Taskâ†’Parent") to a form ([see documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/sandiego-platform-administration/page/administer/form-administration/concept/configure-form-layout.html))
6. **Read the** [**No-Code Citizen Developer Guide for the Now Platform**](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/rome/now-platform/citizen-dev-guide/cd-planning)

**Don'ts**

1. Don't create and import the following data. ServiceNow will take care of that for you
    1. Approvals tracking data such as approval status and dates
    2. Dates related to the case. Ex "submission date"

Nicole made a list of the key data that the team is tracking and is eager to start
