# Conclusion

In this lab, we built, implemented, and tested an application using the fundamental part of an application: Data, User Experience, and Automation.

The team managing the work will be more efficient and the users will get what they need faster.

Let's recap: 

   Pain point      | Impact        | Solution
   ----------------| --------------| -----
   Table label    | Telework Case |
   Auto number    | Checked       | 
   Prefix         | TLW           | 
   Prefix         | TLW           |   

Of course, the examples in these exercises are just the beginning when it comes to the power of leveraging Automation Engine.

The possibilities are limited only by your imagination as a Creator. If you can dream it, you can workflow it on the Now Platform.

Here are some resources to help you continue your journey on the ServiceNow platform
