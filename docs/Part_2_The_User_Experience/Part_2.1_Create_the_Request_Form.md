This takes us to a selection where we can identify the type of experience we wish to create.

1. **Select** the **Record Producer** option.

    Field Name        | Field Value
    ------------------| --------------
    Name              | Apply for Telework

12. Let's add questions to the form

    {: .note }
    Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.


13. We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**

14. **Click** on Questions

15. **Click the arrow next to** Insert new questionthen click "Question set"

    ![relative](./user_form/Click_Insert_new_question.png)

16. Select "Standard Employee Questions" and click Submit

    ![relative](./user_form/Select_Standard_Employee_Questions.png)

17. One key information we need users to provide is the type of arrangement they are applying for.
    1. Click Insert new question
    2. For Question type, select **Choice**
    3. For **Question subtype** , select **Record reference**

    ![relative](./user_form/Question_subtype_select_Record_reference.png)
    
    4. Scroll down to the **Details** section

    5. In the **Details** section, enter the following information: (üí° double-click, copy & paste into the form)

        Field Name                   | Field Value

        **Map to a specific field**  | We want to store that information so let's check the box
        **Table field**              | choose **Arrangement**
        **Question label**           | What type of Telework arrangement are you applying for? |
        **Mandatory**                | Checked |

        {: .note }
