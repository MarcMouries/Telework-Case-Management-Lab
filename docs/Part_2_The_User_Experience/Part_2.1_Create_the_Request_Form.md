This takes us to a selection where we can identify the type of experience we wish to create.

3. **Select** the **Record Producer** option.

1. This launches the record producer creator.

2. Click the [Begin](#){: .aes_button } button

    Field Name            | Field Value

    (1) Name              | Apply for Telework
    (2) Short Description | Use this form to apply for Telework

    {: .note }
    A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create task-based records from the service catalog.

5. Click the [Edit record producer](#){: .aes_button } button

6. Click on **Destination** , then type **Tel**, and select the **Telework Case** table

12. Let's add questions to the form

    {: .note }
    Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.


13. We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**

14. **Click** on Questions

15. **Click the arrow next to** Insert new questionthen click "Question set"

    ![relative](./user_form/Click_Insert_new_question.png)

16. Select "Standard Employee Questions" and click Submit

    ![relative](./user_form/Select_Standard_Employee_Questions.png)

    This will add two frequently asked questions on forms
    ![relative](./user_form/Standard_Employee_Questions_Added.png)


17. One key information we need users to provide is the type of arrangement they are applying for.
    1. Click Insert new question
    2. For Question type, select **Choice**
    3. For **Question subtype** , select **Record reference**

    ![relative](./user_form/Question_subtype_select_Record_reference.png)

    4. Scroll down to the **Details** section

    5. In the **Details** section, enter the following information: (üí° double-click, copy & paste into the form)

        Field Name                   | Field Value
        -----------------------------| --------------
        **Map to a specific field**  | We want to store that information so let's check the box
        **Table field**              | choose **Arrangement**
        **Question label**           | What type of Telework arrangement are you applying for? |

    9. Today, the team is spending a lot of time correcting and manually re-routing applications due to people confusing the different types of Telework arrangement. Let's fix that.

    10. We'll use the  **Annotation**  tab to provide users with additional instructions for the question.

    11. Check the box **Show**** instructions**

    15. **Click** on the [Insert Question](#){: .aes_button } button

    ![relative](./user_form/add_Annotation_Complete.png)

18. Back to the main form, **click** on the [Insert new question](#){: .aes_button } button

    ![relative](./user_form/Click_on_Insert_New_Question.png)

19. When users select the arrangement type **Situational** , we'll prompt them for the number of days per week. 

    1. So, let's go ahead and in the **Type** section set the following values:

23. Close the Preview by clicking on the X on the top right

    ![relative](./user_form/Preview_Close.png)

    {: .note }
    If you want to preview your catalog item in the Virtual Agent you will need to activate the plugins_ _ **Glide Virtual Agent** and **Service Management Virtual Agent Topic Blocks**.

**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to use App Engine Studio (AES) to easily create customized Catalog Items that users can access in Service Portal and on mobile devices.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization
