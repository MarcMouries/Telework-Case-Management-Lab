Only the tables and columns to which you have access are shownClick In the box "What do you want to see?" then type the following query:

 "show me all the telework cases grouped by reason as a bar chart"

1. In the query box remove the part "show me all the". It should read as:
 "telework cases grouped by reason as bar chart"
2. Click the Ask button, and we'll get the same result
3. Try with "as pie chart"
4. Try with "as list". (You can ask for a list first, ex: "list of telework cases grouped by reason"
5. It even understands our own data; Try with "open COVID telework case"
