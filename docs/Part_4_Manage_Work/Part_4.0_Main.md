# Part 4: Manage work

**Purpose**

In this exercise, we will learn how to create user experiences for interacting with our application. We will leverage App Engine Studio to create a new Workspace experience designed to allow the team to track and manage cases across the enterprise.

Before we do so, we'll start by importing cases.
