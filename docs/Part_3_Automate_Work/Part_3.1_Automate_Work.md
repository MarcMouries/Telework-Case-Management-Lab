# Part 3 â€“ Create a Workflow

1. Back to the App Engine tab, **click** on the [Return to my application](#){: .aes_button }

    ![relative](images/work_Return_to_my_application.png)

2. In the Automation section, **click** the **Add a process or third-party integration** link

    ![relative](images/automation_click_Add_a_process.png)

    From the Add Automation Screen, we are provided with a variety of process automation templates we can use to speed creation of common activities.

3. Click "Flow"

    ![relative](images/automation_click_Flow_Tile.png)

4. Click **Build**** from ****scratch** to create a new workflow

    ![relative](images/automation_Click_Build_From_Scratch.png)

    A flow is a sequence of actions to automate processes on the Now Platform.

    Logic and automation use computers to manage repeatable processes instead of using people. Logic and automation can reduce human error and speed up processes. App Engine Studio allows creators to add process flows to their applications.

5. Create the flow with the following information:

    1. Name: Main

    2. Description: Manage the Telework flow of work

    3. Click [Continue](#){: .aes_button }
|
6. **click** the **Edit this flow** button to begin the configuration process

    ![relative](images/automation_your_flow_is_ready.png)

7. Since this is the first time we've launched Flow Designer, we're given the opportunity to go through the Flow Designer product tour.

8. Let's skip the tour for now, by clicking the **Skip tour** button.

The first thing we'll do is set up our trigger to define when this flow will run.

9. Click on " **Add a trigger**" in the upper left of the flow designer screen.

    ![relative](images/automation_click_Add_a_Trigger.png)

    Flow designer provides different options for triggering a workflow. You can kick off a flow based on a record being created or updated, , run on a scheduled basis, or based on a unique application component like an SLA task being triggered or an inbound email being received by the instance.

    For our use case we are going to:

        1. select "Created" from the Record section
        2. and select our **Telework Case** table
        3. Click \_ Done \_ to close the trigger

        ![relative](images/automation_configure_Trigger.png)

    Note that there might be circumstances under which we need to have a particular flow to execute.

    In this case we can use the "Add filters" option to define conditions that must be met for this flow to execute. This helps making flow easier to maintain and reuse.

    For example, we could use a flow specific to new request, one for renewal or request.

    ![relative](images/automation_Example_Trigger.png)


10. Now we'll add the actions to execute when this flow fires.

    1. Click **Add an Action, Flow logic, or Subflow**

    2. Choose " **Action**"

    ![relative](images/automation_Add_Action.png)

11. The first step in the process we want to automate is managing the approvals across departments.

  1. In the search field, type "approval"
  2. Select "Ask for Approval"

    ![relative](images/automation_Select_Ask_for_Approval.png)

12. The first thing we need to configure is the record we'll be working with for this action.

    1. Click on the data picker
    2. Select "Trigger â€“ Record Created"
    3. Select "Telework Case Record"

    ![relative](images/automation_Ask_for_Approval.png)

    1. Choose " **Anyone approves**" for the Approval rule.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've built a flow that takes care of managing tasks and communications across multiple departments.

Note that by default Personal Developer Instances have "sending email" turned off by default.

If you want to receive the email, make sure that the user submitting the application has a valid email address on their user record.

Next, let's test our work and see it in action.
