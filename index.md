## Goals

Digital transformation is more relevant than ever. Powered by the Now Platform, App Engine fuels rapid delivery of Creator Workflows with great experiences for everyone. With more people building with less complexity, App Engine lets you create low-code apps fast, and safely scale cross-enterprise experiences that users love.

Our goals for this workshop are to allow you to:

1. Gain valuable experience through practice with Creator Workflow Builder essentials
2. Convert a real-world use case with process bottlenecks to a streamline, cross enterprise workflow
3. Take back to your organization the knowledge of how you can make your world of work better.
