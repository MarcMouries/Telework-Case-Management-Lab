# Introduction

## Goals

Digital transformation is more relevant than ever. Powered by the Now Platform, App Engine fuels rapid delivery of Creator Workflows with great experiences for everyone. With more people building with less complexity, App Engine lets you create low-code apps fast, and safely scale cross-enterprise experiences that users love.

Our goals for this workshop are to allow you to:

1. Gain valuable experience through practice with Creator Workflow Builder essentials
2. Convert a real-world use case with process bottlenecks to a streamline, cross enterprise workflow
3. Take back to your organization the knowledge of how you can make your world of work better.

## Use-case

Amanda is part of the Office of Regulatory Affairs and her team responsible for managing different cases across the agency. One of their responsibilities is to ensure employees are approved to work remotely and have the necessary I.T. equipment to protect and manage the records and other sensitive information stored on telework devices and transmitted across external networks. Currently, her team has no centralized case management solution for tracking the status of telework cases and tasks across 3 departments (the employee's department, the HR department, and the IT department). Today the team is using:

| **Emails** | **Spreadsheet** |
| --- | --- |
|
1. Receive Submissions
2. Track approvals & tasks across departments
  1. IT for Remote Access request
  2. HR for Safety & Manager
3. Communicate task updates
 |
- Manage updates to Telework cases
 |
| **PDF / Word Form**
- Telework request form
 |
|
 |

### Challenges

The lack of a single platform to manage their work results in:

| **Wasted Time** wasted staff time coordinating and communicating updates. |
 | **Staff Burnout** Staff Burnout as much of the work focuses on the crisis of the moment instead of planned and leveled workload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unnecessary Firefighting** Unnecessary Firefighting by the team to avoid security and safety issues |
 | **Poor Visibility** Lack of clear status of the work across departments. |

Amanda and her team have reached out to the IT department for help, but they have no availability to take on new projects. However, they gave Amanda access as a Citizen Developer to the organization's ServiceNow development instance.

Today your mission, and you have accepted it, is to play the role of Amanda and create a solution to efficiently manage cross-departmental work.

Let's make her world of work better‚Ä¶

### Planning

Along with the ServiceNow instance URL and credentials, the I.T department sent you an email to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow App Engine.

![Shape1](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_9635ab4c0a180660.gif)

üí° **Prework to start your Citizen Developer Journey on ServiceNow**

**Prework**

1. Make a list of the data you need to track. Ex: Category of work
2. Reach for help on the channel @transformNow
3. If you're using a spreadsheet today, make a copy and keep only the data required. See the Don'ts section
4. Use the record producer to create a form quickly and reuse any relevant questions set
5. If case workers need to create and see tasks related to the case, add the related list ( "Task-\>Parent") to a form ([see documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/sandiego-platform-administration/page/administer/form-administration/concept/configure-form-layout.html))
6. **Read the** [**No-Code Citizen Developer Guide for the Now Platform**](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/rome/now-platform/citizen-dev-guide/cd-planning)

**Don'ts**

1. Don't create and import the following data. ServiceNow will take care of that for you
  1. Approvals tracking data such as approval status and dates
  2. Dates related to the case. Ex "submission date"

Nicole made a list of the key data that the team is tracking and is eager to start

**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how to create a new application and map out the data elements important to enable our business process.

We learned to use the Table Builder to add and configure columns including Reference fields and Choice lists.

We were able to complete all these tasks using simple point-and-click administration and without requiring specialized application or database knowledge.

# Exercise 2: Create the User Experience

Let's add questions:

Unlike in a paper-based form, we don't need to ask users to fill personal information like first name, last name, ‚Ä¶, or date of request. That information will be automatically attached to the case. This makes filling forms so much faster.

We want to allow users to open a case on behalf of another individual, so let's start by asking users " **Who is this request for?**" and " **When do you need this?"**

1. **Click** on Questions
2. **Click the arrow next to** Insert new questionthen click "Question set"
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_ec16fe2cba49f65f.png)

**Exercise Recap**

In this exercise, we learned how Use App Engine Studio (AES) to easily create customized Catalog Items that users can access in Service Portal and on mobile devices.

Our next exercise will focus on taking the building blocks created to this point and making them actionable to drive automation and process optimization

# Exercise3‚ÄìAutomate the work

**Purpose**

In this exercise, we will move beyond simply digitizing data entry and we will focus on ways we can drive optimization though automation

## Section1‚ÄìBuildinganAutomation Flow

1. Back to the App Engine tab, **click** on the \_ Return to my application \_

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_c95dc1f45f320adb.png)

1. In the Automation section, **click** the **Add a process or third-party integration** link

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_5b2e2567b75bd0fd.png)

From the Add Automation Screen, we are provided with a variety of process automation templates we can use to speed creation of common activities.

1. Click "Flow"
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_991f4007666333e8.png)


2. Click **Build**** from ****scratch** tocreateanewcustomflow

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_85ae604dcb17d8e.png)

A flow is a sequence of actions to automate processes on the Now Platform.

Logic and automation use computers to manage repeatable processes instead of using people. Logic and automation can reduce human error and speed up processes. App Engine Studio allows creators to add process flows to their applications.

1. Set up the flow

|

  1. Name
 | **Main** |
| --- | --- |
|

  1. Description
 | **Manage the flow of work** |
|

  1. Click \_Continue\_
 |

1. **click** the **Edit this flow** button to begin the configuration process

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_ea5bd0d382f5405b.png)

1. Since this is the first time we've launched Flow Designer, we're given the opportunity to go through the Flow Designer product tour.


2. Let's skip the tour for now, by clicking the Skip tour button.

The first thing we'll do is set up our trigger to define when this flow will run.

1. Click on " **Add a trigger**" in the upper left of the flow designer screen. ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_d5d2dc069803d64b.png)

Flow designer provides different options for triggering a workflow. You can kick off a flow based on a record being created or updated, , run on a scheduled basis, or based on a unique application component like an SLA task being triggered or an inbound email being received by the instance.

For our use case we are going to :

  1. select "Created" from the Record section
  2. and select our **Telework Case** table
  3. Click \_ Done \_ to close the trigger

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_65fd0d872f4dcb02.png)

Note that there might be circumstances under which we need to have a particular flow to execute.

In this case we can use the "Add filters" option to define conditions that must be met for this flow to execute. This helps making flow easier to maintain and reuse.

For example, we could use a flow specific to new request, one for renewal or request.

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_8125caf7712d33dc.png)

1. Now that we have configured the trigger, we need to set up what will happen when this flow fires.

  1. Click **Add an Action, Flow logic, or Subflow**
  2. Choose " **Action**"

 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_e451db40e40bb726.png)

1. The first step in the process we want to automate is managing the approvals across departments.

  1. In the search field, type "approval"
  2. Select "Ask for Approval"

 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_3cb4d6a5f1f5b0d9.png)

1. The first thing we need to configure is the record we'll be working with for this action.

  1. Click on the data picker
  2. Select "Trigger ‚Äì Record Created"
  3. Select "Telework Case Record"

![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_d14a0bc9da16c5e8.png)

1. Click: \_Done\_


2. Click: \_Save\_ in the top right corner of the screen

Although the Flow is saved, it won't run until we activate it.

1. Click on the \_Activate\_ button on the left of the Save button

1. In the Confirmation box click the Activate button.

Congratulations! üéâ You've built a flow that takes care of managing tasks and communications across multiple departments.

Note that by default Personal Developer Instances have "sending email" turned off by default.

If you want to receive the email, make sure that the user submitting the application has a valid email address on their user record.

Next, let's test our work and see it in action.

## Section 2‚Äì Testing a Flow

In this section, we will test the flow we just created and make sure it functions as expected.

We need to test with a user who has a manger, fortunately ServiceNow allows to impersonate other authenticated users for testing purposes

Let's go back to the ServiceNow admin page

1. In the banner frame, click your profile photo in the top right to open the user menu.
2. Select  **Impersonate User**.
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_e5b3c305c9c87e33.png)

The Impersonate User dialog box appears.

1. Search for "David Loo" (who has a manager).
2. Select him
3. Click Impersonate User
4. Close the pop-up
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_76f709f143a1a46e.png)

Let's go back to the ServiceNow Portal page and submit a new application.

1. Open a new browser tab and go to https://\<instance\_name\>.service-now.com
2. Search for Telework
3. Open the catalog item
4. Complete and Submit the form
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_6d6676a854d98f3f.png)

**Let's check the execution:**

1. Go back to the ServiceNow admin page
2. Impersonate David Loo's manager : Bud Richman"
3. With email enabled on the instance and a valid email address, the manager would get an email notification and allow the manager to approve or reject.
4. Let's check if the manager has any approval request in "My Approvals list"
  1. In the search, type "my approvals"
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_3debc5c8c48ee299.png)
  2. Click on "My approvals"


  3. Yes. There is one. Right-click on the "Requested"


  4. Select "Approve"
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_f74aeaa1fa465721.png)

1. Next, let's check if an email was sent
  1. In the top right, click the profile photo to open the User menu.
  2. Select  **"End Impersonation"**.
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_7836a501e0dcc8f3.png)


  3. on the top-left, type " **Outbox**"
  4. Select " **Outbox**"
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_911f49aebc43b40f.png)


  5. We have an email! Click on it to open it
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_ab840a5dfa38d075.png)

  1. On the email record, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on Preview Email
 ![](RackMultipart20221028-1-d1lmac_html_874007f64808961c.png)

  1. And voila! Observe the email that was sent.

    1. We have automated case updates notifications.


    2. Notice the watermark at the bottom of the email. ServiceNow generates a watermark label at the bottom of each notification email to allow matching incoming email to existing records. This helps track emails sent as part of a case and manage responses to emails.

Congratulations! You successfully built and tested a workflow that saves a lot of time in the organization and makes sure tasks are assigned.

# Conclusion

In this lab, we built, implemented, and tested an application using the fundamental part of an application: Data, User Experience, and Automation.

The team managing the work will be more efficient and the users will get what they need faster.

Of course, the examples in these exercises are just the beginning when it comes to the power of leveraging Automation Engine.

The possibilities are limited only by your imagination as a Creator. If you can dream it, you can workflow it on the Now Platform.

Here are some resources to help you continue your journey on the ServiceNow platform
